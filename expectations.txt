As CMSC 100 is Web Programming, I expect to learn concepts that will help me create functional as well visually pleasing website. I also expect to learn more about git and GitHub as it seems that it will always be used. Overall, I expect to learn new topics and concepts under the field of Computer Science which will help me improve as a Computer Science student.
